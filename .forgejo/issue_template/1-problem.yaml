      ### New workflow
      
      We are currently experimenting with a new workflow to manage issues and better understand your problems and needs. This is step 1 of the workflow: Please try to focus on explaining the problem you are facing, which could be a bug in the code, a moment of confusion, or a need that you have.
      
      We do not expect anything from Forgejo users after creating a problem report, but we appreciate if you stay responsive to further questions. If you want, you can also participate in a discussion for solutions.
      
      Forgejo contributors will review your report, try to understand how important it is to you and other Forgejo users, and suggest potential solutions. In a next step, solutions can be documented and implemented.
      
      If you want to learn more about the background of our workflow, feel invited to read and participate in [the discussion that led to the current approach](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/discussions/issues/415). We are looking forward to your feedback.

      Please try reproducing your problem at https://dev.next.forgejo.org or a local development version of Forgejo.
      If you check that your problem is not already addressed by a recent change, this will save all volunteers involved a lot of time.
    options:
    - "Yes, the problem still exists (tested on a next instance)"
    - "Yes, the problem still exists (tested locally with the latest development version)"

    label: About your usage of Forgejo
    description: |
      Please provide a brief description of your usage of Forgejo. There is no clear guideline on how much you need to share here. You can be brief, but we value the insights you provide us to better understand your use case. Thank you very much!
      <details><summary>Further instructions</summary>
      
      * When reporting problems with certain functionality, you should include related information. Examples:
        * When reporting an issue with setting up an identity provider, it is useful to know if you use Forgejo in a 10-users non-profit / start up, or if you are talking about a school / university with several thousands of users.
        * When describing confusion, it will be relevant to know your skill level and background ("New, but used a similar product", "In my role as a project manager ..."), so we know for which target audience we need to design the functionality.
        * When reporting workflow issues or needs, it will be useful to know how large your project is, how many team members you have, which skill level we are talking about etc. For example, we might choose a different design depending on whether a feature is only for professional developers or for hobby coders.
      * If you want, we always appreciate generic information about your Forgejo usage to help us understand your usage and make better decisions. For example:
        * Your personal relation to Forgejo and user role ("I'm new to Forgejo, but used a comparable product called …", "In my role as a designer, …").
      * If you already explained your usage of Forgejo elsewhere (e.g. in another issue or in a user research repository), feel free to just drop a link.
