      ### New workflow
      
      We are currently experimenting with a new workflow to manage issues and better understand your problems and needs. This is step 2 of the workflow, which is intended for Forgejo contributors: If you just want to raise a problem or need you have, please refer to step 1.
      
      This step allows to document a solution to one or multiple problems. It allows developers to focus on actionable implementation tasks without the clutter of previous discussions or triaging work.
      
      If you want to learn more about the background of our workflow, feel invited to read and participate in [the discussion that led to the current approach](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/discussions/issues/415). We are looking forward to your feedback.
