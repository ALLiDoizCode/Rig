This release includes an upgrade of Go version with security fixes. The issues addressed by this update do not pose any risk to the system or data security of Forgejo deployments, only potential for denial of service attacks.

Forgejo v13.0 is end of life since 15 January 2026, however, since the release schedule currently doesn't have overlap of supported dates for major releases, it receives an upgrade for use by those who couldn't address the breaking changes in the Forgejo v14.0.0 release yet.
