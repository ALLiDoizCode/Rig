Foreign keys have been added to the Forgejo database schema, which may identify data inconsistencies during the v41 database schema upgrade. If migration errors occur, `forgejo doctor check --all` can be used to identify the inconsistent records, which can be manually corrected or deleted. `forgejo doctor check --all --fix` will automatically delete the inconsistent records. Affected tables in this release are: `stopwatch` (references `issue` and `user`), and `tracked_time` (references `issue` and `user`).
