If SSH is enabled and an `authorized_keys` file is managed by Forgejo, when Forgejo starts up it will read the SSH authorized_keys file and validate the file's contents. If any keys are found in the file that are not expected, then Forgejo will terminate its startup in order to signal to the server administrator that a security risk is present that must be addressed. The server administrator can address this problem either by deleting the `authorized_keys` file, which Forgejo will regenerate with valid keys; or by disabling the new check by setting `[server].SSH_ALLOW_UNEXPECTED_AUTHORIZED_KEYS = true` in their `app.ini` file.
